# BedtechAnticheat
A simplified version of the original bedtech engine anticheat for vanilla bedrock servers/realms/LAN-games originally created to serve as a simple automatic anticheat for vanilla bedrock dedicated servers & realms

# IMPORTANT INFO
This is an older more simplified form of the original bedtech anticheat engine and has last been tested in 1.14.X Bedrock edition. Some commands might not properly work when behavior pack is used. Feel free to add pull requests and changes and I will review them and add them to the main branch ONLY if proven to be safe changes to the anticheat

# tile.end_gateway.name might work. If not just change the dahm block values to be breakable and change the texture to obsidian.tile to make your life easier
# weird values 
# not f*cking sure why these are still in the game but whatever 
# jeb_ please remove invisible bedrock and just add an actual world barrier like java

# items that are still illegal for players to have but admins might need them at times
# only disable script if nessesary
# UPDATED: Admin chemistry blocks added
